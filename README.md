## Wildstagram

### Presentation

The application is composed of 3 screens which will have the following functionality :

- To take a picture
- View and upload photos
- See photos of others

We can use a Tab Navigation to navigate between these 3 screens.</br>
With each icon allowing to go to the corresponding page.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 14+ (check by running node â€“version in your console)
* Download and install <b>Expo Go</b> on your iOS or Android physical device or emulator
* Install <b>Expo CLI</b> on your development machine (If it's not done yet)
  - Run `npm install -g expo-cli`
  - If the installation does not work you can run :
    1. `npm cache clean --force`
    2. `sudo npm install --unsafe-perm -g expo-cli`

### Steps

1. Clone the repo from GitHub : `git clone git@github.com:jaldabaoth-code/Wildstagram.git`
2. Enter the directory : `cd Wildstagram`
3. Run `npm install`
   - If you have an error <b>*Maximum call stack size exceeded*</b> you can run :
     1. `npm cache clean --force`
4. Run `expo start`
5. <b>The Developer tool</b> will run and a QR Code will be displayed on your development machine
6. Now you can launch <b>Expo Go</b> application on your iOS or Android physical device or emulator
7. Click on <b>Scan QR code</b> and take a picture of the QR code which is displayed on your development machine</br>
8. <b>Wildstagram</b> will open on your iOS or Android physical device or emulator
9. Allow the permissions, on your iOS or Android physical device or emulator

Note : Your <b>Developer tool</b> on your development machine AND your <b>Expo Go</b> on your iOS or Android physical device or emulator must be on the same network
